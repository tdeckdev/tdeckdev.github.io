I really don't know how to begin, to be quite honest. It took me an agonizing 3 hours to set this repo up due to Arch and Ruby shenanigans, and now I'm finding myself with little to say and barely able to stay awake. But what I do know is that I hope this is beginning of something great.

I have been a developer for quite a while, I can barely remember graduation, and how uncertain I felt. I won't go into too much detail, but even as I have grown in experience and finding myself at a place my older self wouldn't even believe, I have come to realize that uncertainty has not gone away at all. Of course, I am better of that I was before, much better pay, better mental state, a partner. But even so, I always come back to feeling incomplete. I realized that I have not done what I really wanted to do from when I aspired to be a developer. I look back at how far I've come and I ask myself, what have you made? Is your name out there? Did you even try?

Of course, I know being a Software Engineer isn't about beign seeing most of the time. Most of us stay in the shadows, our names forgotten in a commit somewhere on some big company's project. But even in that sense I think I'm also not doing enough for my regular job. That I need to learn more, that I actually know nothing. A failure. As you can see, Impostor Syndrome in full swing. So, to put an end to it, I decided to start fresh. A new name. A place where I can focus and make all of my ideas, big or small (they might not even be related to coding sometimes). That is The Deck, my own hub, where I will be posting my day to day, my ideas, progress of projects, all in one place. I hope to stay here for a while, and built something I look back with pride, even if its just the improvement on my blog writing skills. Even if it doesn't work out, we will have a fun time.

So if you are reading this, regardless if you found it while looking at one of my (hopefully) future launched projects, some other page, or just by chance while typing random words and see a sad looking website with close to 0 entries, I hope that at the very least, it motivates you to do the same as me. To try and to keep trying, and make something you feel proud of.

We will be talking again very soon.

To a new dawn, amist the ending of a sunset.

TDeck.
