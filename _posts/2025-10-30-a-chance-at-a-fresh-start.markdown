Well, here we are. After I wrote my first post last night, I started thinking of what I really wanted to do with this space, and I decided it will be a good start to just list my wishes for the rest of year and foward!. Take it as my New Years resolutions (I know we are barely in November, but I always though waiting until New Years Eve is just the lazy man's way of making excuses). I have 4 clear hefty goals on my mind as of now:

## Blog touchup

I already modified the theme of the blog so my eyes can rest a bit, but I want to take the proper time to make it a space I would go to read from time to time (Also, to try and get out of the default Hacker theme look)

## Low-Level Programming

As someone who has pretty much stuck to Android for most of his life, with a sprinkle of web here and there, low level always seems as the esoteric wild west. But I've been getting more involved with it since my switch to Arch, so I think is a good time to lear a bit and have some fun while doing it.

## Cleanup Linux setup

After my switch to Arch, I've been tinkering here and there with some DE's and WM's, but I need to take the proper time to choose a nice setup and have the environment work ready. I've only tried Hyprland so far, but I found out some things about the author of it and I'm feeling kinda on the fence about using it now. But alternatives like Sway/SwatFX seem to do just as fine, and I could also benefit from less animations (Better focus).

## Projects!

I can't mention it right now, but I have my big idea on the conceptualization phase, and I hope I can atleast get onto the planning phase before the end of the year. All I can say about this project is that It will help me stay more organized, as I'm making it with that as one of its primary goals.

Thats pretty much it for now! But I gotta bring up something else to end this on an important note. Today I had one of those moments when you see a fork on the road. I see the two paths I have in front of me, and life has giving me the chance to follow the good path. I almost fucked up, but I think is pretty symbolic how I made this blog the day before, as if life is telling me to go on the right track. So time to get going!

P.S: I noticed I have made this blog a sort of diary lmao, more for myself than the reader hahahaha. But as this is my first time writing a blog, I hope I can get better over time and make good articles. In the meatime, I hope you can endure how I think, and I do intend to make this post more dev-centric over time!
